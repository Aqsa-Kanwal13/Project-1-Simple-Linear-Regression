Simple Linear Regression Project:
This project involved working on a Simple Linear Regression task as part of an internship with CodexCue. Here are the key steps and methodologies used:

Dataset Overview: The dataset comprised 7 columns and 244 rows with no null values.
Data Preprocessing:
Removed duplicate values and confirmed the absence of null values.
Handled categorical variables using label encoding to convert them into numerical format.
Created visualizations including scatter plots, and pair plots.
Data Splitting:
Designated 'total_bill' as the independent variable and 'tip' as the dependent variable.
Split the data into train and test sets.
Model Building:
Applied the Linear Regression model and evaluated it using Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score.
Additional Features:
Used Multiple Linear Regression incorporating all 7 columns (6 independent and 1 dependent).
Re-evaluated the model with the added features.
Polynomial Features:
Worked with Polynomial features.
Re-evaluated the model to observe changes in performance.
